# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dug into `box-shadow` and started a deep dive into CSS in general. 

**Thoughts:** My goal with 100 days of code is to become so confident with CSS that I can look at virtually any UI mockup and think "Yeah, I could make that".  So today I started with a design trend that really interests me, which is Neumorphism/Skeumorphism.  I took [these mockups](https://dribbble.com/shots/11652074-FREE-Neumorphism-UI-Kit) as inspiration.  

Tomorrow, I'll be implementing a dark theme, and (hopefully) a toggle for going back and forth between light and dark.  Optimally, I'll also clean up the CSS and introduce some variables.

### Day 1: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Usage of `::before` and `::after` to create a slider, and programmatically changing CSS variables with JS 

**Thoughts:** Using `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to create a toggle out of a checkbox was weird, and not what I expected the solution to creating a toggle to be, but it worked pretty well.  Programmatically changing the CSS variables that control the background colors, box shadows, etc was also interesting and definitely illuminates how much easier frameworks make certain things (i.e. in AngularJS, I could have just thrown an ng-class on everything that looked at if the checkbox was checked or not and modified the theme accordingly).  However, this helped me in regards to JS fundamentals like getting the root element, getting arrays of elements, and manually changing styles on them.   

Tomorrow, I'm not entirely sure what I'll do.  I think I'll probably clean up this code a little bit, see if there's ways I can condense the JS side of things. After that, I'll probably find more elements to add to this page or build in this style.  Maybe I'll end up just making a full profile page?  We'll see!
