# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dug into `box-shadow` and started a deep dive into CSS in general. 

**Thoughts:** My goal with 100 days of code is to become so confident with CSS that I can look at virtually any UI mockup and think "Yeah, I could make that".  So today I started with a design trend that really interests me, which is Neumorphism/Skeumorphism.  I took [these mockups](https://dribbble.com/shots/11652074-FREE-Neumorphism-UI-Kit) as inspiration.  

Tomorrow, I'll be implementing a dark theme, and (hopefully) a toggle for going back and forth between light and dark.  Optimally, I'll also clean up the CSS and introduce some variables.
